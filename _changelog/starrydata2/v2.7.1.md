### Design Changes

- **Enhanced Visibility of the Project List**

Previously, when a project was not added to My List, the project list was displayed in gray, making it appear inactiveâ€”even though it was still clickable. With this update, the list now always appears active, regardless of registration status, making it more intuitive for users.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="vertical-align: top;">Before</th>
      <th style="vertical-align: top;">After</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <img src="/assets/changelog/starrydata2/v2.7.1/project-list-before.png" width="400">
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <img src="/assets/changelog/starrydata2/v2.7.1/project-list-after.png" width="400">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Bug Fixes

#### XY Data Input Screen

1. **Figure Caption Textarea Adjustment**
   Resolved an issue where expanding the caption textarea caused it to be obscured by other input fields, preventing further resizing.

2. **Improved Message Display Behavior**
   Fixed a problem where the success or failure messages after saving XY data remained on screen indefinitely. Now, messages automatically disappear after 4 seconds.

#### Figure Name Display

In both the XY data input and summary screens, the figure name now includes the prefix "Figure". This change reverts the removal of the prefix made in the [v2.5.0 release](/changelog/starrydata2/v2.5.0/).
