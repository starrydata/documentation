# Redesigned Summary Screen Graphs

In this release, we've enhanced the summary screen graphs to provide clearer insights into data trends. By connecting data points with lines, users can now better visualize patterns over time. Additionally, we've expanded the logarithmic scale option to include the X-axis, which was previously available only for the Y-axis.

## Additional Features

### Toggle Data Point Visibility via Legend Click

You can now click on the legend to hide or show specific data points, giving you more control over the graph's display.
