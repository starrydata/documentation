## New Features

### 1. Direct Plotting of Selected Graph Points on the Visualizer from the Summary Screen

Previously, the Visualizer was updated via a batch process twice a day, so newly registered data was not reflected immediately. With the integration between the Visualizer and StarryData2, you can now view the latest data instantly. This enhancement enables comparative analysis with other large datasets after data collection, making it easier to detect unit errors and better understand data characteristics.

### 2. Implementation of ID-Based Sorting in the Figure and Sample Lists

Since [v2.5.0](https://docs.starrydata.org/changes/starrydata2/v2.5.0/), sorting has been done in natural order. However, depending on the data collection situation, there are cases where displaying items in registration order is necessary. To address this, we have added a feature that allows sorting by clicking on the table headers (Figure ID, Figure Name, Sample ID, Sample Name, and Composition).

## Minor Fixes

### 1. UI Improvements for Paper Search

- **Trimming of Search Keywords**
  Leading and trailing newline characters and half-width spaces in the input string are automatically removed, ensuring that the search results meet expectations.

  <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style="vertical-align: top;">Before</th>
        <th style="vertical-align: top;">After</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/search-with-line-break-before.png" width="400">
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/search-with-line-break-after.png" width="400">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

- **Display Improvement When No Search Results Are Found**
  When no search results exist, the previously empty display area is now replaced with a "No Result" message.

  <table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style="vertical-align: top;">Before</th>
        <th style="vertical-align: top;">After</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/show-nothing.png" width="400">
        </td>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
          <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/show-no-result.png" width="400">
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

### 2. Improvement of XY Value Display Precision on Graph Hover

Previously, when hovering over a data point on a graph, the XY values were rounded to the fourth decimal place, and if the fifth digit was 4 or less, it was displayed as 0. With this update, the values are now displayed accurately with 6 significant figures.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="vertical-align: top;">Before</th>
      <th style="vertical-align: top;">After</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/hover-value-before.png" width="400">
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
        <img src="/assets/starrydata2/v2.6.0/hover-value-after.png" width="400">
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 3. [Data Input Screen] Fix for Error When Pressing Save with an Empty Exponent for 10^0

Previously, if the multiplier for 10^0 was left empty and the Save button was pressed, an error would occur. This update changes the behavior so that an empty exponent is ignored, preventing the error. Additionally, the "10^" label is displayed in grey when the exponent is empty, providing a more intuitive indication of the state.

These are the new features and fixes included in v2.6.0. We will continue to work on improvements to enhance usability in future updates.
